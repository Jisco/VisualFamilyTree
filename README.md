# VisualFamilyTree

With this app you can create a family tree with extensive information and pictures about the individual family members. The whole thing can be done very simply using the mouse and a few keystrokes. An editor to export this family tree in different formats (pdf, svg, png) is also included. The output can be configured extensively.
